    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup cornmeal (fine or medium grind)</li>
        <li>2 cups whole milk</li>
        <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>1/4 cup unsalted butter, melted</li>
        <li>2 large eggs, lightly beaten</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups corn kernels (fresh or thawed frozen)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>1/4 cup sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons fresh chives, chopped (for garnish)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C). Grease a cast iron skillet or baking dish with butter.</li>
        <li>In a saucepan, combine cornmeal, milk, and heavy cream. Whisk constantly over medium heat until thickened (5-7 minutes).</li>
        <li>Remove from heat. Stir in melted butter, sugar, salt, and pepper. Let cool slightly, then whisk in eggs.</li>
        <li>Fold in corn kernels and Parmesan cheese until well combined.</li>
        <li>Pour the mixture into the prepared skillet. Smooth the top and bake for 30-35 minutes, or until the edges are golden and the center is set.</li>
        <li>Garnish with fresh chives and serve warm.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <p>
        - <strong>Whisking:</strong> Constant whisking is critical to avoid lumps in the cornmeal.<br>
        - <strong>Skillet vs Dish:</strong> A cast iron skillet gives the pudding golden edges but a baking dish works fine.<br>
        - <strong>Serving Suggestions:</strong> Best served warm alongside a hearty steak or roasted chicken.<br>
        - **Texture Note:** Inspired by our discussion, this pudding relies on fine or medium cornmeal rather than blending the corn to preserve texture.<br>
        - **Learning:** This was developed as part of our "Steak School" — where we experiment and perfect side dishes for steak dinners.
