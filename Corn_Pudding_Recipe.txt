STK-Inspired Corn Pudding

Ingredients:
- 1 cup cornmeal (fine or medium grind)
- 2 cups whole milk
- 1 cup heavy cream
- 1/4 cup unsalted butter (melted)
- 2 large eggs, lightly beaten
- 1 1/2 cups fresh or frozen corn kernels (thawed if frozen)
- 1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
- 1/4 cup granulated sugar (adjust to taste)
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 teaspoon black pepper
- 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional)
- 2 tablespoons fresh chives, finely chopped (for garnish)

Instructions:
1. Preheat Oven: Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Grease a cast iron skillet or baking dish with butter.
2. Cook the Cornmeal Base: In a medium saucepan, combine the cornmeal, milk, and heavy cream. Cook over medium heat, whisking constantly, until the mixture thickens to a porridge-like consistency (about 5-7 minutes). Remove from heat.
3. Incorporate Butter and Eggs: Stir in the melted butter, sugar, salt, and black pepper. Let it cool slightly, then whisk in the beaten eggs.
4. Add Corn and Cheese: Fold in the corn kernels and grated Parmesan cheese until evenly mixed.
5. Assemble and Bake: Pour the mixture into the prepared skillet or baking dish. Smooth the top with a spatula and bake for 30-35 minutes or until the edges are golden and the center is set but slightly jiggly.
6. Garnish and Serve: Sprinkle with fresh chives before serving warm.

Optional Upgrades:
- Drizzle with honey butter for a sweet-savory touch.
- Add crumbled bacon for extra flavor.
- Finish with a light drizzle of truffle oil for luxury.
